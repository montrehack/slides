// plug the groupies

== We suck at CTF

and so we decided to start training together

== man montrehack

* Every 3rd Monday of the month
* @notman 6pm - 9pm + benelux after
* Someone proposes a challenge
* We get excited

== montrehack --help

* We show up with a laptop
* We hack in small ad-hoc teams
* We get the answer at the end
* We discuss
* `#include geekness.h`

== montrehack --version

* 8 editions so far
* Covering: Crypto, Unix exploitation, iOS forensics, networking, Web, some more crypto and binary
* We are not better at CTF yet :(

== How we run this

* Very little organisation
* Mostly on mailing lists: montrehack and now montrehack-meta
* We harass people to submit stuff

== $you: we need your help!

* Consider presenting a challenge
  https://github.com/montrehack/montrehack.github.com/wiki/Present-at-Montrehack
* Help manage our communities
* Subscribe on montrehack-meta and offer help
* TODO: logistics, planning, promo, logo, better organise content, etc.

== Next month
