March Network Challenge Write-Up
================================

EXPLOITATION
------------

* Inspect network.pcap
* Realize that the client is using rare option 90 in his DHCP request with
  values that wireshark cannot parse
* Spoof the MAC Address (just in case)

    sudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:1c:25:b6:22:c8

Hard way
~~~~~~~~

* Implement custom DHCP client in scapy. But we are lazier than this.


Easy way
~~~~~~~~

* Edit `/etc/dhclient.conf`. Add on top the following lines:

    # the hack
    option auth code 90 = string;
    send auth = "PopTheShell";

* Kill dhclient (on Ubuntu it will restarted automatically)
* Go browser some weird site like kittenwars.com
* Be redirected
* Get the Flag
* ...
* Profit!
