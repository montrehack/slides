== Abstract submitted

Montréhack is a monthly workshop where every attendee participates in solving
real Capture-The-Flag (CTF) exercises. Solutions to the problems are presented
at the end of the meeting and participants discusses additional tips, tools
and approaches to the problem.

This talk will cover why we started Montréhack, how it works and where we want
to take it. We will highlight some of the challenges we presented and share
some lessons, tools and techniques we’ve learned that are applicable no matter
the challenge at hand.

Please note that for the lulz, some of our mistakes will be revealed.

[{notes}]
Thankfully because of Guillaume's presentation I know I don't need
to explain CTF

== !

Archives of past challenges on our Website

[{notes}]
====
Most of them includes files to redo the challenges and solution (homemade
or write-up)

In fact we can go back up to the 70s'

Network, Reverse-Engineering, SQL Injection, Steganography and Web

== !

Covered International and Local CTFs

Advent Calendar CTF, Boston Key Party, CySCA, CSAW, Hackfest, NorthSec, PlaidCTF, Hack.lu

We feature some of the Web's gems in order to present our challenges

But montrehack is also...

[data-background-image=images/famous-joan.jpg, {contain}]
== !

a place to meet celebrities

[{notes}]
like the upcoming speaker

[{title}]
== Why

== !

Be better at CTF

== !

Because we sucked at Defcon Quals

[data-background-image=images/scoreboard.png, {contain}]
== !

[{notes}]
Primarily add depth to the team

== !

We didn't really succeeded at that

[{notes}]
I'm old, I have kids, I don't know as much CTFs

== !

In fact its more about *routine* and *doing*

[.small]
True story bro

[{notes}]
====
* routine: No matter what, I spend at least 3 hours a month on CTFs
  (and then beer with friends).
* doing: no talks where you hear other people do stuff, you do the stuff and
  your machine is always ready to go to war
====

[{title}]
== How

== !

Someone proposes a challenge

We work on it

He presents his solution after 3 hours

[.small]
We go for beer after

[{notes}]
but sometimes, like last week, we just go straight to the beer

== !

Participants must bring laptops

Hack in ad-hoc teams

[.small]
Make friends (optional)

== When

3rd Monday of every month*

[.small]
*: certain restrictions apply, see website for details

== Where

Notman house, UQAM or Google offices

[.small]
then Benelux

== Who

Pierre-Marc Bureau, Sebastien Duquette, Marc-Etienne M.Leveillé and myself

[{notes}]
====
stand-up guys

new management model where we assign ourselves specific months and do
everything mostly alone

== Shout-outs

== !

Alexandre Rimthong for the montrehack name

Past presenters: Taher Azab, Xavier Garceau-Aranda, Pierre-Marc Bureau,
Marc-Etienne M.Leveillé, Charles F.Hamilton, Philippe Arteau, Pierre-David
Oriol, Marc-André Labonté, Sébastien Lorrain, Mathieu Lavoie, Benjamin
Vanheuverzwijn, Sébastien Duquette, Gabriel Tremblay, Jonathan Marcil, Laurent
Desaulniers, François Proulx and myself

== A Few Awards Should Go To

== !

Most montrehack attended without actually working on the challenges

[data-background-image=images/initnull.jpg, {contain}]
== !

Our very own NorthSec President *Mr Gabriel Tremblay*

== !

Longest challenge explanation

[.small]
Going 3x over allocated timeslot

[data-background-image=images/proulx.jpg]
== !

NorthSec's Logistics VP *Mr. François Proulx*

[.small]
His challenge and explanation was good though

== !

Making us secretly exploit a 0-day vulnerability in some library

[data-background-image=images/arteau.jpg]
== !

NorthSec's challenge maker Philippe Arteau

On an XXE injection in Apache Batik (CVE-2015-0250)

[{title}]
== Lessons

== Lesson #0

Co-maintainership doesn't work

[{notes}]
====
having core volunteers and expecting them to spread the load (one does fb,
other email and website, etc.) didn't work

when we embraced one pre-assigned guy per months things started to go way
better (less late announcements, etc.)
====

== Lesson #1

We accidentally offended several communities

We're sorry

[{notes}]
can't really give more details because it might offend others but just keep
this in mind when doing social events

== Lesson #2

It takes time

[data-background-image=images/timespent.png, {contain}]
== !

[{notes}]
as you can see making those funny pictures can take a while

== Lesson #3

Having checkpoints along a complex challenge is a good thing

[{notes}]
We stop to provide hints to make sure no one is stalled. People tend to
regroup at these stages and still make progress.

[{title}]
== Tools and techniques

== !

There are no single tools or techniques

[.small]
The END

[{notes}]
joking aside, people tend to use various tools, he are what I decided to
highlight (I don't speak on behalf of others)

== !

Learn a scripting language

Accumulate snippets of codes and re-use them, expand them over time

[{notes}]
wait for it

== !

but preferably python3

== !

Use ipython and ipython notebook

[{notes}]
if you've never used notebook, you GOT to give it a try

== !

No plain gdb

fancy `.gdbinit` or
https://github.com/crowell/p3da[p3da]

== !

From time to time try https://github.com/radare/radare2[radare2] instead of
a pirated IDA Pro

[{notes}]
Its getting there. I presented a full crackme type challenge using it.

== !

Wireshark is da bomb and learn tshark

[.small]
Especially `-T fields -e data` and then some piping into python with `fileinput`
module for further processing.

== !

Web: Burp or Owasp ZAP

[{notes}]
Its been a while since I've done web so these might not be the best

== !

Use `vagrant` for disposable VMs

== !

Learn to use a powerful text-editor like `vim`, `sublime` or `emacs`

Preferably `vim`

== !

Learn to use the developers tools of your browser

[{notes}]
Most of the modern web challenges can be done that way. The 'copy as curl'
chrome command is awesome

[{title}]
== What's next?

== !

Sponsored by the Benelux for a free beer after the workshop

image:benelux.png[]

[{notes}]
expect round of applause. We are really glad about this

== !

No breaks this summer

== !

Next month we get a Googler from Seattle
